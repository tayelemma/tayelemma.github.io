       My name is Taye Lemma and I did my graduate degree in
      Molecular Pharmacology in Loyola University Chicago Illinois. I have
      always want to study computer science but I got caught up with many
      responsibilities. Now, when the right time comes, I joined  <abbr title="Maharishi International University ">MIU</abbr> August 10,
      2021 to study Master in Software Development. I completed the prerequisite
      for Master in Software Development program successfully and 
      ready to achieve my dream.
